# ChemDone

## Installation
ChemDone automatically installs dependencies upon the first run. How cool is that?

## Setup
After downloading ChemDone, all you have to do is have the file in the same directory as a terminal session to run it. If the file `chemdone.py` is alone on your desktop, the following script will run it as is:\
`$ cd Desktop`\
`$ python3 chemdone.py`\

If you want to get fancy, you can do this:\
`$ cd Desktop`\
`$ chmod u+x chemdone.py`\
`$ ./ chemdone.py`\

If you want to be a show off:\
`$ cd Desktop`\
`$ chmod u+x chemdone.py`\
`$ cp ./chemdone.py /usr/bin/chemdone`\
`$ chemdone`\

## Usage


## Disclaimer
We at ChemDone don't encourage academic dishonesty, so don't use this to do your homework or anything like that. That wouldn't be very nice. Just use it to check your practice work or something like that.
